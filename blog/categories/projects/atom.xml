    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I cleaned up an earlier project I'd left hanging around called Colby. It's a little
wrapper around the data structures that the Hamster gem provides, and it adds some functions
to make working with those data structures a little similar to the Clojure-way.</p>

<p>At this point, Colby is very experimental and is only at a <code>0.0.1</code> release to reflect its
brittleness. However, all specs pass currently and it's useable as-is. I've pushed the initial
release to RubyGems, so you can start using Colby by just doing <code>gem install colby</code>.</p>

<p>Comments welcome! I realize this may be a bit simple compared to <a href="https://github.com/rouge-lang/rouge">rouge</a>, which is an awesome
project, but I'll keep this around for my own edification.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Github link: <a href="http://github.com/gnarmis/repomap">RepoMap</a></p>

<p>There are hundreds of git repositories stored at various folder depths all over
my computer. Organizing them, remembering where they are or determining whether
I still have a working copy cloned from a remote repository is a chore.</p>

<p>So, why not have a map of where all my repositories are? Should be simple
enough to keep a YAML file with a map from paths to repository names.</p>

<p>After some hacking on a flight (after having finished finals and an interview),
I made a little Ruby CLI program and found it to be useful enough to expand into
a tiny little gem. It's still very basic, and specs aren't where they should be,
but the essentials are there.</p>

<p>It's called RepoMap, and you can find it here:
<a href="http://github.com/gnarmis/repomap">http://github.com/gnarmis/repomap</a>.</p>

<p>You can also install it by typing <code>gem install repomap</code>.</p>

<p>Check out the above link for details about how it works. Pull requests are
welcome! I'm thinking there's a number of cool additions possible, such as
mining all that useful meta data about git repositories, and making use of the
map in interesting ways.</p>

    <link href="http://gnarmis.github.com/blog/2012/07/06/creating-a-simple-sentiment-analyzer-using-cl/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-06T19:49:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://gnarmis.github.com/blog/2012/07/06/creating-a-simple-sentiment-analyzer-using-cl</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR <a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/sentimental">https://github.com/gnarmis/sentimental</a></p>

<p>Sentiment analysis is the hot thing to do these days. One example is ViralHeat,
a social media monitoring platform that uses sentiment analysis to provide
a picture about how the conversation is trending about certain keywords (or
combinations of keywords, which they call profiles). There's a lot of such
products, and for developers there's a lot of high-quality and extensive libraries
and toolkits that provide for this among other solutions, such Java's WEKA
or OpenNLP, or Python's NLTK. There's even many third-party solutions that
provide an API you can use to get sentiment analysis, such as AlchemyAPI.</p>

<p>After deciding to create my very own sentiment analysis tool using Clojure,
I began researching libraries in both Java and Clojure (because Clojure's interop
means that I can easily use Java libraries). There's a lot of powerful tools
out there, but my goal was to find something simple that could allow me to
make a good enough sentiment analyzer without breaking the technical bank,
so to speak.</p>

<p>At first, I was looking for facilities to stem words, for which someone had
already provided a Clojure-wrapper around the Java library Snowball. <a href="http://kilotau.com/a-brief-foray-into-deploying-clojure-librarie">I forked
this and deployed it to Clojars</a>. This, and a simple list of stop words
to ignore, would allow me to reduce redundancies and get a "bag of words" representation
of the target document.</p>

<p>Next, I wanted a nice and simple NLP library. <a href="https://github.com/dakrone/clojure-opennlp">Clojure-OpenNLP</a> fit the
bill perfectly. It even had a document categorizer I could train!</p>

<p>Now, I should briefly explain the overall process. At the heart of the sentiment
analyzer is a naive-Bayesian classifier. This classifier is provided with a
labelled list as training material ("sad" is "negative", "happy" is "positive").
The various categories are the sentiments, such as "positive", "negative",
"neutral" (I used 6 categories, for strong/weak sentiment). The classifier
then learns to associate categories with words, based on training information
that is supplied to it. Given a new sentence, the classifier then calculates
the probabilities of each word belonging to each category, and the category
with the best probability of covering the sentence is returned. Learn more
about how to build naive-Bayes classifiers <a href="http://bionicspirit.com/blog/2012/02/09/howto-build-naive-bayes-classifier.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>So, the next step was to get the actual training data. I found the <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/">subjectivity
lexicon</a> to fit my needs perfectly. After parsing the document into a vector
of hash-maps, I was able to create a <a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/sentimental/blob/master/src/models/sentiment.train">training document</a> for my very own
opennlp model, which was to be the classifier. The other step was to create
a function that would remove stop words and also stem each word. This was pretty
easy to do using the <a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/snowball-stemmer">snowball-stemmer</a> library and a few lines of Clojure.</p>

<p>Granted, I didn't build my own naive-Bayes classifier, but that's a project
for another time :)</p>

<p>And here's the project: https://github.com/gnarmis/sentimental</p>

<p>You do need to install Leiningen and have JDK 1.6 on your machine. After these
two steps, simply <code>cd</code> into the project and type <code>lein repl</code>, following the
example in the readme.</p>

    <id>http://gnarmis.github.com/blog/2012/07/05/snowball-stemmer-deploying-a-simple-clojure-wrapper</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having found an <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/snowball-stemmer">awesome little wrapper</a> for <a href="http://snowball.tartarus.org/">Snowball</a> (which allows
for stemming of words, like "going" -> "go"), I decided that it was the perfect
opportunity to try creating my very own "Clojar" and deploying it. It didn't
take long to fork the repo, make an account on clojars.org, make some minimal
changes, and deploy this library. The nice thing is that everyone now has an
easy way to try this out. I'm honestly surprised it was this easy and quick
to deploy the thing!</p>

<p>Check out my fork: (<a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/snowball-stemmer)">https://github.com/gnarmis/snowball-stemmer)</a></p>

<p>And the clojar itself is here: (<a href="https://clojars.org/org.clojars.gnarmis/snowball-stemmer)">https://clojars.org/org.clojars.gnarmis/snowball-stemmer)</a></p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
