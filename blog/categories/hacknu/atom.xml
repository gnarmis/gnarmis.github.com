    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been a busy few days at Hack Northwestern! We got a <a href="http://hacknorthwestern.com">new home</a>, announced a <a href="http://hacknorthwestern.com/imo-hackathon.html">hackathon</a> sponsored by <a href="http://imo.im">imo</a>, and just wrapped up a tech talk / hack night by folks from <a href="http://seelio.com">Seelio</a> yesterday!</p>

<p>It's humbling to note that this started as an idle suggestion last spring, and then a quick get-together of around 7 students. Here's an <a href="http://northbynorthwestern.com/story/30-collaborate-eat-pizza-at-hackathon/">article</a> about only the second such hack night, which exploded to around 30-40 people (even some from UChicago!). The idea behind this effort has stayed constant: fostering student creativity, entrepreneurship, and hacker spirit. It's a testament to Northwestern's active entrepreneur and hacker community that Hack Northwestern is seeing such quick validation of its efforts.</p>

<p>As we continue to build connections between different communities at Northwestern and the tech world at large, we find an undercurrent of excitement that is inspiring. And hearing about similar such efforts at various other universities is even more gratifying.</p>

<p>University is more than just a trade school, and Hack Northwestern hopes to prove that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Me and Jonathan Chan (@jonishungry) had quite the adventure last weekend. Managing
a two hour El ride; being completely lost on the UChicago campus; sleeping
in a tiny student government office since the venue wasn't 24/7 (graciously
provided by @hackuc); discovering that Fermi worked in Ryerson Hall (where
we hacked), and that Carl Sagan used to go to the observation tower there.
Oh, and winning second place (by 1 vote)!</p>

<p>The app we built was <a href="http://soundingboard.heroku.com">SoundingBoard</a>: a crowd-driven music player. Let's
say you have a venue and you want to play some music while also allowing people
to suggest artists they love (with minimal effort on your part). You sign in
with an Rdio account, give us the place name in a hashtag-friendly manner,
give us the place's address, and we setup a page for you that plays songs.
Now, put this up on a screen and people can tweet their favorite artists (with
the appropriate hashtag) in order to add them to the artist pool. The player
then randomly selects from the artist pool, which ranks artists based on the
number of mentions in tweets/retweets. Needless to say, it was an API-wrangling
bonanza, with lots of hard decisions about which features we had to cut and
which were absolutely essential to the experience. It was also probably our
most productive 30 hour sprint ever.</p>

<p>We successfully demoed our app, adding tweets live which were parsed for artist
names, updating the pool and affecting the next song's choice. And we almost
won the whole thing! But it's ok; we still got VIP tickets to TEDxUChicago,
which promises to be amazing. Enova, the company backing the hackathon, and
the hack@uchicago team (@hackuc)Â should be lauded for supporting such an amazing
event.</p>

<p>We were definitely thrilled to see some validation of our idea and want to
explore it further. Any updates will be up on our launch-rock page at <a href="http://soundingboard.heroku.com">http://soundingboard.heroku.com</a>,
and emailed to everyone who's signed up to our mailing list!</p>
