    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend, me and Jonathan Chan spent a straight thirty hours working on
<a href="http://getsoundboard.com">SoundBoard</a>, a crowd-driven music player, and had a blast! Our app won
second place by a single vote, and we won VIP tickets to the TedX - UChicago
event. It's been a hectic week, but it's satisfying to see a project emerge out
of a weekend of feverish coding.</p>

<p>Here's how SoundBoard works. You, the host of some kind of party, want good
music playing but also want crowd participation, but don't have time or money
to hire a DJ. Head over to SoundBoard, login with an Rdio account on any modern
browser, choose an appropriate hashtag for your shindig, and let SoundBoard
start playing songs! People can tweet things like "#sb #bestpartayevah
radiohead" and then Radiohead gets added to the pool of artists from which
SoundBoard picks songs. Leave the SoundBoard playing while connected to a TV
and you have a great, participatory music experience!</p>
