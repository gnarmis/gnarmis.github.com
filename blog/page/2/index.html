  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://webnoir.org">Noir</a> is an excellent, Sinatra-like framework in Clojure, and <a href="http://sqlkorma.com">Korma</a>
is a great companion. But in a lot of database-backed services, you often need
migrations to make sane changes to the database and have the abilitiy to roll
back your various schema changes. Lobos is a little library (among a few) that
tries to do this, but seeing only a few examples <a href="http://www.vijaykiran.com/2012/01/17/web-application-development-with-clojure-part-2/">here</a> and <a href="http://pupeno.com/2011/08/20/how-to-use-lobos-with-heroku/">there</a>,
I decided to make my own little template that explores this.</p>

<p>So, here&#8217;s the repo: <a href="http://github.com/gnarmis/korma-lobos-tpl">http://github.com/gnarmis/korma-lobos-tpl</a>.</p>

<p>I did run into an issue trying to find out how to do the classic &#8220;alter&#8221; SQL
command to add a column using Lobos. Turns out, just try <code>(doc alter)</code> after
first typing in that first long <code>(use ...)</code> command in the repo&#8217;s readme. But
I just documented the bug for now.</p>

<p>Also, there is a very simple entity definition to demonstrate Korma, and I&#8217;ve
tested the setup and confirmed that the migration executed, and the entity
got added.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll maybe explore Drift in the future, although there&#8217;s already <a href="https://github.com/pjlegato/korma-drift-template">this excellent
template</a> I could build on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m really digging this wonderful little language called Clojure. It&#8217;s a modern
Lisp, meaning it has all the functional goodness I have been craving after
using Racket. It&#8217;s awesome being able to build things like interpreters and
type checkers, which I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be able to approach so easily (this
was part of an awesome programming languages class taught by Robbie Findler).
But Clojure is also a JVM language and can be compiled ahead of time, so it&#8217;s
exceedingly practical and efficient. You can use any Java library and interop
with other JVM languages pretty well.</p>

<p>Clojure is a young language, but has a very energetic community. It&#8217;s also
seeing use both in industry and startups. Check out <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Clojure-powered-Startups">this talk</a> for more
on that.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of resources out there too. I&#8217;ve gone through parts of <a href="http://www.clojurebook.com/">Clojure
Programming</a>, done some challenges on <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/">4Clojure</a>, played around with <a href="http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/06/24/its-playtime/">Light
Table Playground</a>, and keep finding more things to explore. One book I definitely
want to explore is <a href="http://joyofclojure.com/">The Joy of Clojure</a>. Also, I&#8217;ve decided to go through
SICP using clojure, and ran across <a href="http://sicpinclojure.com/">this gem</a>.</p>

<p>As for tools, I&#8217;ve tried <a href="http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/">CounterClockwise</a> and <a href="http://devnet.jetbrains.net/community/idea/clojure">La Clojure</a>, but for
now I&#8217;ve settled for my usual lightweight editor: Sublime Text 2, with SublimeREPL.
Having a syntax-highlighted REPL that behaves like my editor is pretty nice. <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/">Leiningen</a> has
been brilliant as a dependency-management tool, which also supports a host
of other things like building, testing, running, or launching a REPL with your
project. Honestly, Leiningen is the best dependency manager I&#8217;ve ever used.
I wish there was something this good in Ruby-land.</p>

<p>A great place to find links to all sorts of tools for Clojure development is <a href="http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/">Clojure
Toolbox</a>. It shows how practical Clojure is today.</p>

<p>I have to mention <a href="http://webnoir.org/">Noir</a> and <a href="http://sqlkorma.com/">Korma</a>. If you&#8217;re into web dev, you might
find yourself loving the simplicity of Noir and the interesting functional
approach to persistence in Korma. I find it awesome that <a href="http://chris-granger.com/">Chris Granger</a>,
the guy behind Light Table, wrote both of them.</p>

<p>Btw, #clojure on irc.freenode.net is friendly!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Introducing <a href="http://whatshere.herokuapp.com">What&#8217;s Here?</a>, an app to help you explore your local people,
places, and tweets.</p>

<p>This mobile app was an exploration of a project idea about searching and making
sense of locally relevant data. It was explored in the context of my <a href="http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/course-descriptions/eecs-395495-special-topics-innovation-in-journalism-a-technology.html">Journalism
&amp; Tech project class</a>.</p>

<p>You can use this app on any modern smartphone, though it was tested only on the
iPhone 4. Also, you can try the app on a tablet or regular computer&#8217;s
browser as well.</p>

<p>The premise was this: a person walking around in a downtown area wants to find
out what the buzz is about their current location. Perhaps they want a super
quick way to find out the most interesting places nearby. They could launch
Google Maps and search for things, and then perhaps switch to other apps such as
FourSquare that similarly provide information about places nearby.  They could
also launch several other apps, or drill down to the comments in the Yelp app,
to find out what people are saying about places. There isn&#8217;t currently a single
app or a single experience which meshes all these various information-finding
activities together. Another thing to consider is recommendations based on that
person&#8217;s Twitter activity, and how that should affect their search.</p>

<p>Using Hunch and Twitter&#8217;s API, we built a mobile experience that was designed to
solve the problem of providing local and personally relevant information in one
application. All that is required from the user is their Twitter username. Using
this and the geolocation provided by the phone, we derive a lot of useful
information, such as a grouped list of the most relevant places, tweets about
those places, people near those places, and related places of interest. There
are three types of such inter-linked areas of information: places, people, and
tweets. These are provided as part of the tabbed navigation.</p>

<p>This project is currently a functioning prototype that shows enough promise to
be worth iterating on or reexamining from the ground up.</p>

<p>Me and Jon are finally at the stage where we can start showing off our <br/>
idea called SoundBoard, which was conceived and well received at a <br/>
hackathon last weekend. After talking about it with several great <br/>
people at TEDxUChicago, we feel the need to learn as much as possible <br/>
about how people use it. We have also put up a link on the site to <br/>
allow easy feedback, so be sure to check it out and tell us what you <br/>
think!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last weekend, me and Jonathan Chan spent a straight thirty hours working on
<a href="http://getsoundboard.com">SoundBoard</a>, a crowd-driven music player, and had a blast! Our app won
second place by a single vote, and we won VIP tickets to the TedX - UChicago
event. It&#8217;s been a hectic week, but it&#8217;s satisfying to see a project emerge out
of a weekend of feverish coding.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how SoundBoard works. You, the host of some kind of party, want good
music playing but also want crowd participation, but don&#8217;t have time or money
to hire a DJ. Head over to SoundBoard, login with an Rdio account on any modern
browser, choose an appropriate hashtag for your shindig, and let SoundBoard
start playing songs! People can tweet things like &#8220;#sb #bestpartayevah
radiohead&#8221; and then Radiohead gets added to the pool of artists from which
SoundBoard picks songs. Leave the SoundBoard playing while connected to a TV
and you have a great, participatory music experience!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the link: <a href="http://getsoundboard.com">SoundBoard</a>. Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Me and Jonathan Chan (@jonishungry) had quite the adventure last weekend. Managing
a two hour El ride; being completely lost on the UChicago campus; sleeping
in a tiny student government office since the venue wasn&#8217;t 24/7 (graciously
provided by @hackuc); discovering that Fermi worked in Ryerson Hall (where
we hacked), and that Carl Sagan used to go to the observation tower there.
Oh, and winning second place (by 1 vote)!</p>

<p>The app we built was <a href="http://soundingboard.heroku.com">SoundingBoard</a>: a crowd-driven music player. Let&#8217;s
say you have a venue and you want to play some music while also allowing people
to suggest artists they love (with minimal effort on your part). You sign in
with an Rdio account, give us the place name in a hashtag-friendly manner,
give us the place&#8217;s address, and we setup a page for you that plays songs.
Now, put this up on a screen and people can tweet their favorite artists (with
the appropriate hashtag) in order to add them to the artist pool. The player
then randomly selects from the artist pool, which ranks artists based on the
number of mentions in tweets/retweets. Needless to say, it was an API-wrangling
bonanza, with lots of hard decisions about which features we had to cut and
which were absolutely essential to the experience. It was also probably our
most productive 30 hour sprint ever.</p>

<p>We successfully demoed our app, adding tweets live which were parsed for artist
names, updating the pool and affecting the next song&#8217;s choice. And we almost
won the whole thing! But it&#8217;s ok; we still got VIP tickets to TEDxUChicago,
which promises to be amazing. Enova, the company backing the hackathon, and
the hack@uchicago team (@hackuc) should be lauded for supporting such an amazing
event.</p>

<p>We were definitely thrilled to see some validation of our idea and want to
explore it further. Any updates will be up on our launch-rock page at <a href="http://soundingboard.heroku.com">http://soundingboard.heroku.com</a>,
and emailed to everyone who&#8217;s signed up to our mailing list!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining something
that I&#8217;m trying to understand: I keep making up examples. For instance, the
mathematicians would come in with a terrific theorem, and they&#8217;re all excited.
As they&#8217;re telling me the conditions of the theorem, I construct something
which fits all the conditions. You know, you have a set (one ball) - disjoint
(two halls). Then the balls turn colors, grow hairs, or whatever, in my head
as they put more conditions on. Finally they state the theorem, which is some
dumb thing about the ball which isn&#8217;t true for my hairy green ball thing, so
I say, &#8220;False!&#8221;</p>

<p> If it&#8217;s true, they get all excited, and I let them go on for a while. Then
I point out my counterexample.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh. We forgot to tell you that it&#8217;s Class 2 Hausdorff homomorphic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; I say, &#8220;It&#8217;s trivial! It&#8217;s trivial!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Introducing Rocketship: a Rack based template that integrates multiple micro-frameworks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/rocketship"><strong>github.com/gnarmis/rocketship</strong></a></p>

<p>I recently came across some useful Sinatra templates and ended up having to
integrate several things together in a service I&#8217;m currently working on. So,
I extracted the basic stuff out and it&#8217;s turned out to be useful for spinning
up a quick web service. Best thing is that it doesn&#8217;t impose a strict structure
and you can follow best-practices of your micro-framework of choice.</p>

<p>Currently, Rocketship integrates Grape and Sinatra, along with a bevy of testing
facilities.</p>

<p>Comments/improvements welcome!</p>

<p>Update: Some significant changes, including one that makes apps able to handle
more requests concurrently.</p>
