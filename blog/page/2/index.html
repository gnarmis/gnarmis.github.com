  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m really digging this wonderful little language called Clojure. It&#8217;s a modern
Lisp, meaning it has all the functional goodness I have been craving after
using Racket. It&#8217;s awesome being able to build things like interpreters and
type checkers, which I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be able to approach so easily (this
was part of an awesome programming languages class taught by Robbie Findler).
But Clojure is also a JVM language and can be compiled ahead of time, so it&#8217;s
exceedingly practical and efficient. You can use any Java library and interop
with other JVM languages pretty well.</p>

<p>Clojure is a young language, but has a very energetic community. It&#8217;s also
seeing use both in industry and startups. Check out <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Clojure-powered-Startups">this talk</a> for more
on that.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of resources out there too. I&#8217;ve gone through parts of <a href="http://www.clojurebook.com/">Clojure
Programming</a>, done some challenges on <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/">4Clojure</a>, played around with <a href="http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/06/24/its-playtime/">Light
Table Playground</a>, and keep finding more things to explore. One book I definitely
want to explore is <a href="http://joyofclojure.com/">The Joy of Clojure</a>. Also, I&#8217;ve decided to go through
SICP using clojure, and ran across <a href="http://sicpinclojure.com/">this gem</a>.</p>

<p>As for tools, I&#8217;ve tried <a href="http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/">CounterClockwise</a> and <a href="http://devnet.jetbrains.net/community/idea/clojure">La Clojure</a>, but for
now I&#8217;ve settled for my usual lightweight editor: Sublime Text 2, with SublimeREPL.
Having a syntax-highlighted REPL that behaves like my editor is pretty nice. <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/">Leiningen</a> has
been brilliant as a dependency-management tool, which also supports a host
of other things like building, testing, running, or launching a REPL with your
project. Honestly, Leiningen is the best dependency manager I&#8217;ve ever used.
I wish there was something this good in Ruby-land.</p>

<p>A great place to find links to all sorts of tools for Clojure development is <a href="http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/">Clojure
Toolbox</a>. It shows how practical Clojure is today.</p>

<p>I have to mention <a href="http://webnoir.org/">Noir</a> and <a href="http://sqlkorma.com/">Korma</a>. If you&#8217;re into web dev, you might
find yourself loving the simplicity of Noir and the interesting functional
approach to persistence in Korma. I find it awesome that <a href="http://chris-granger.com/">Chris Granger</a>,
the guy behind Light Table, wrote both of them.</p>

<p>Btw, #clojure on irc.freenode.net is friendly!</p>

<p>Me and Jon are finally at the stage where we can start showing off our <br/>
idea called SoundBoard, which was conceived and well received at a <br/>
hackathon last weekend. After talking about it with several great <br/>
people at TEDxUChicago, we feel the need to learn as much as possible <br/>
about how people use it. We have also put up a link on the site to <br/>
allow easy feedback, so be sure to check it out and tell us what you <br/>
think!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Me and Jonathan Chan (@jonishungry) had quite the adventure last weekend. Managing
a two hour El ride; being completely lost on the UChicago campus; sleeping
in a tiny student government office since the venue wasn&#8217;t 24/7 (graciously
provided by @hackuc); discovering that Fermi worked in Ryerson Hall (where
we hacked), and that Carl Sagan used to go to the observation tower there.
Oh, and winning second place (by 1 vote)!</p>

<p>The app we built was <a href="http://soundingboard.heroku.com">SoundingBoard</a>: a crowd-driven music player. Let&#8217;s
say you have a venue and you want to play some music while also allowing people
to suggest artists they love (with minimal effort on your part). You sign in
with an Rdio account, give us the place name in a hashtag-friendly manner,
give us the place&#8217;s address, and we setup a page for you that plays songs.
Now, put this up on a screen and people can tweet their favorite artists (with
the appropriate hashtag) in order to add them to the artist pool. The player
then randomly selects from the artist pool, which ranks artists based on the
number of mentions in tweets/retweets. Needless to say, it was an API-wrangling
bonanza, with lots of hard decisions about which features we had to cut and
which were absolutely essential to the experience. It was also probably our
most productive 30 hour sprint ever.</p>

<p>We successfully demoed our app, adding tweets live which were parsed for artist
names, updating the pool and affecting the next song&#8217;s choice. And we almost
won the whole thing! But it&#8217;s ok; we still got VIP tickets to TEDxUChicago,
which promises to be amazing. Enova, the company backing the hackathon, and
the hack@uchicago team (@hackuc) should be lauded for supporting such an amazing
event.</p>

<p>We were definitely thrilled to see some validation of our idea and want to
explore it further. Any updates will be up on our launch-rock page at <a href="http://soundingboard.heroku.com">http://soundingboard.heroku.com</a>,
and emailed to everyone who&#8217;s signed up to our mailing list!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining something
that I&#8217;m trying to understand: I keep making up examples. For instance, the
mathematicians would come in with a terrific theorem, and they&#8217;re all excited.
As they&#8217;re telling me the conditions of the theorem, I construct something
which fits all the conditions. You know, you have a set (one ball) - disjoint
(two halls). Then the balls turn colors, grow hairs, or whatever, in my head
as they put more conditions on. Finally they state the theorem, which is some
dumb thing about the ball which isn&#8217;t true for my hairy green ball thing, so
I say, &#8220;False!&#8221;</p>

<p> If it&#8217;s true, they get all excited, and I let them go on for a while. Then
I point out my counterexample.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh. We forgot to tell you that it&#8217;s Class 2 Hausdorff homomorphic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; I say, &#8220;It&#8217;s trivial! It&#8217;s trivial!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Introducing Rocketship: a Rack based template that integrates multiple micro-frameworks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/rocketship"><strong>github.com/gnarmis/rocketship</strong></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I recently came across some useful Sinatra templates and ended up having to
integrate several things together in a service I&#8217;m currently working on. So,
I extracted the basic stuff out and it&#8217;s turned out to be useful for spinning
up a quick web service. Best thing is that it doesn&#8217;t impose a strict structure
and you can follow best-practices of your micro-framework of choice.</p>

<p>Currently, Rocketship integrates Grape and Sinatra, along with a bevy of testing
facilities.</p>

<p>Comments/improvements welcome!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently found a (somewhat old) but great repository: https://github.com/daddz/sinatra-rspec-bundler-template.
The structure really helps you build modular Sinatra apps and has the basics
needed for you to jump in and start building.</p>

<p>However, after discovering the joys of the <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/simplecov">SimpleCov</a> gem, which generates
code coverage reports in HTML, I wanted to tweak this already-awesome repository.
Also, I wanted a few more Rake tasks to help with everyday development.</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/sinatra-rspec-bundler-template">here&#8217;s my fork</a> with some improvements.</p>

<p>To begin, just define your own app like the one defined in lib/foo.rb. You
can create multiple such apps and route requests to each one separately. To
do that, just add those mappings to config.ru (foo and bar have been configured
in this manner).</p>

<p>This template also uses Bundler to manage its dependencies, so if you need
a new gem just add it to the Gemfile and run <code>bundle install</code>. I also recommend
using RVM to manage your gems (create a new gemset for each app).</p>

<p>Also, use RSpec to test your app, and run the specs with the defined Rake tasks.
Run <code>rake</code> or <code>rake help</code> to see available tasks. Run <code>rake spec</code> to run your
specs defined under spec/.</p>

<p>You can generate code coverage reports by running <code>rake coverage</code>.</p>

<p>You can also run a console with your app&#8217;s environment by running <code>rake console</code>.</p>

<p>So, there you have it: a simple template with enough structure to support your
Sinatra development.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Northwestern&#8217;s <a href="http://nucats.org">CATS</a> group is an amazing mix of technical and creative
talent, and I recently had a great opportunity to help people interested in
web development get their feet wet. I decided to choose Sinatra, which I&#8217;m
actively using at my <a href="http://nux.northwestern.edu">work</a> and which allows a greatly simplified introduction
to real web development.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=oDwZPXfCOYs</p>

<p>Also, here&#8217;s a link to the associated Github repo: https://github.com/gnarmis/meerkat</p>

<p>Based on this experience, I&#8217;m hoping to teach a few more mini-courses in the
coming quarters. Maybe RESTful services? Mobile dev? There&#8217;s quite a few useful
topics to choose from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When developing locally, I find it useful to have the full development server
logs available. Luckily, Rails 3.1 does this for you in the file ./log/development.log.
However, if you want something similar for other frameworks/commands that run
continuously and post any errors, etc, directly to the terminal, something
like this is useful:</p>

<p>[code]rails s >> console.out 2>&amp;1 &amp;[/code]</p>

<p>(Replace <code>rails s</code> with any similar command)</p>

<p>Also, you can easily send signals (like ctrl-c) to background processes with
<code>kill</code>.</p>

<p>List of signals:</p>

<p>[code]kill -l[/code]</p>

<p>Closing a background process with id 1:</p>

<p>[code]kill -s SIGKILL %1[/code]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you use Sass and CoffeeScript? Tired of remembering and typing out the compile
and watch commands on both of those command-line utilities? I used to do:</p>

<p>[code] compass watch <br/>
 coffee -o scripts/ -cw coffee/ [/code]</p>

<p>&#8230;on all of my projects, in separate tabs on the terminal. There had to be
an easier way.</p>

<p>Do them both, with the standard configuration, using the script below. Download
it into your project, do</p>

<p>[code]chmod +x sassycoffee.sh[/code]</p>

<p>to make it executable, and forget about it! I&#8217;m planning on some edits in the
future, but it works well enough and gets the job done. Now, all you need to
do is:</p>

<p>[code]./sassycoffee.sh[/code]</p>

<p>This was a quick little hack in bash but pretty helpful for my workflow.</p>
