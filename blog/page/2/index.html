<p>Me and Jon are finally at the stage where we can start showing off our <br/>
idea called SoundBoard, which was conceived and well received at a <br/>
hackathon last weekend. After talking about it with several great <br/>
people at TEDxUChicago, we feel the need to learn as much as possible <br/>
about how people use it. We have also put up a link on the site to <br/>
allow easy feedback, so be sure to check it out and tell us what you <br/>
think!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Me and Jonathan Chan (@jonishungry) had quite the adventure last weekend. Managing
a two hour El ride; being completely lost on the UChicago campus; sleeping
in a tiny student government office since the venue wasn&#8217;t 24/7 (graciously
provided by @hackuc); discovering that Fermi worked in Ryerson Hall (where
we hacked), and that Carl Sagan used to go to the observation tower there.
Oh, and winning second place (by 1 vote)!</p>

<p>The app we built was <a href="http://soundingboard.heroku.com">SoundingBoard</a>: a crowd-driven music player. Let&#8217;s
say you have a venue and you want to play some music while also allowing people
to suggest artists they love (with minimal effort on your part). You sign in
with an Rdio account, give us the place name in a hashtag-friendly manner,
give us the place&#8217;s address, and we setup a page for you that plays songs.
Now, put this up on a screen and people can tweet their favorite artists (with
the appropriate hashtag) in order to add them to the artist pool. The player
then randomly selects from the artist pool, which ranks artists based on the
number of mentions in tweets/retweets. Needless to say, it was an API-wrangling
bonanza, with lots of hard decisions about which features we had to cut and
which were absolutely essential to the experience. It was also probably our
most productive 30 hour sprint ever.</p>

<p>We successfully demoed our app, adding tweets live which were parsed for artist
names, updating the pool and affecting the next song&#8217;s choice. And we almost
won the whole thing! But it&#8217;s ok; we still got VIP tickets to TEDxUChicago,
which promises to be amazing. Enova, the company backing the hackathon, and
the hack@uchicago team (@hackuc) should be lauded for supporting such an amazing
event.</p>

<p>We were definitely thrilled to see some validation of our idea and want to
explore it further. Any updates will be up on our launch-rock page at <a href="http://soundingboard.heroku.com">http://soundingboard.heroku.com</a>,
and emailed to everyone who&#8217;s signed up to our mailing list!</p>

that I&#8217;m trying to understand: I keep making up examples. For instance, the
mathematicians would come in with a terrific theorem, and they&#8217;re all excited.
As they&#8217;re telling me the conditions of the theorem, I construct something
which fits all the conditions. You know, you have a set (one ball) - disjoint
(two halls). Then the balls turn colors, grow hairs, or whatever, in my head
as they put more conditions on. Finally they state the theorem, which is some
dumb thing about the ball which isn&#8217;t true for my hairy green ball thing, so
I say, &#8220;False!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Introducing Rocketship: a Rack based template that integrates multiple micro-frameworks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/rocketship"><strong>github.com/gnarmis/rocketship</strong></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I recently came across some useful Sinatra templates and ended up having to
integrate several things together in a service I&#8217;m currently working on. So,
I extracted the basic stuff out and it&#8217;s turned out to be useful for spinning
up a quick web service. Best thing is that it doesn&#8217;t impose a strict structure
and you can follow best-practices of your micro-framework of choice.</p>

<p>Currently, Rocketship integrates Grape and Sinatra, along with a bevy of testing
facilities.</p>

<p>Comments/improvements welcome!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently found a (somewhat old) but great repository: https://github.com/daddz/sinatra-rspec-bundler-template.
The structure really helps you build modular Sinatra apps and has the basics
needed for you to jump in and start building.</p>

<p>However, after discovering the joys of the <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/simplecov">SimpleCov</a> gem, which generates
code coverage reports in HTML, I wanted to tweak this already-awesome repository.
Also, I wanted a few more Rake tasks to help with everyday development.</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/sinatra-rspec-bundler-template">here&#8217;s my fork</a> with some improvements.</p>

<p>To begin, just define your own app like the one defined in lib/foo.rb. You
can create multiple such apps and route requests to each one separately. To
do that, just add those mappings to config.ru (foo and bar have been configured
in this manner).</p>

<p>This template also uses Bundler to manage its dependencies, so if you need
a new gem just add it to the Gemfile and run <code>bundle install</code>. I also recommend
using RVM to manage your gems (create a new gemset for each app).</p>

<p>Also, use RSpec to test your app, and run the specs with the defined Rake tasks.
Run <code>rake</code> or <code>rake help</code> to see available tasks. Run <code>rake spec</code> to run your
specs defined under spec/.</p>

<p>You can generate code coverage reports by running <code>rake coverage</code>.</p>

<p>You can also run a console with your app&#8217;s environment by running <code>rake console</code>.</p>

<p>So, there you have it: a simple template with enough structure to support your
Sinatra development.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Northwestern&#8217;s <a href="http://nucats.org">CATS</a> group is an amazing mix of technical and creative
talent, and I recently had a great opportunity to help people interested in
web development get their feet wet. I decided to choose Sinatra, which I&#8217;m
actively using at my <a href="http://nux.northwestern.edu">work</a> and which allows a greatly simplified introduction
to real web development.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=oDwZPXfCOYs</p>

<p>Also, here&#8217;s a link to the associated Github repo: https://github.com/gnarmis/meerkat</p>

<p>Based on this experience, I&#8217;m hoping to teach a few more mini-courses in the
coming quarters. Maybe RESTful services? Mobile dev? There&#8217;s quite a few useful
topics to choose from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When developing locally, I find it useful to have the full development server
logs available. Luckily, Rails 3.1 does this for you in the file ./log/development.log.
However, if you want something similar for other frameworks/commands that run
continuously and post any errors, etc, directly to the terminal, something
like this is useful:</p>

<p>[code]rails s >> console.out 2>&amp;1 &amp;[/code]</p>

<p>(Replace <code>rails s</code> with any similar command)</p>

<p>Also, you can easily send signals (like ctrl-c) to background processes with
<code>kill</code>.</p>

<p>List of signals:</p>

<p>[code]kill -l[/code]</p>

<p>Closing a background process with id 1:</p>

<p>[code]kill -s SIGKILL %1[/code]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you use Sass and CoffeeScript? Tired of remembering and typing out the compile
and watch commands on both of those command-line utilities? I used to do:</p>

<p>[code] compass watch <br/>
 coffee -o scripts/ -cw coffee/ [/code]</p>

<p>&#8230;on all of my projects, in separate tabs on the terminal. There had to be
an easier way.</p>

<p>Do them both, with the standard configuration, using the script below. Download
it into your project, do</p>

<p>[code]chmod +x sassycoffee.sh[/code]</p>

<p>to make it executable, and forget about it! I&#8217;m planning on some edits in the
future, but it works well enough and gets the job done. Now, all you need to
do is:</p>

<p>[code]./sassycoffee.sh[/code]</p>

<time datetime="2011-07-19T22:04:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 19<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a particularly interesting time trying to install TinyPM, which is a
Java-based project management solution. After searching el goog for a bit,
I couldn&#8217;t find an exact walkthrough or recipe, so I decided to make one here
for anyone else who&#8217;s looking into doing the same.</p>

<p>First, the platform. I chose Amazon&#8217;s Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2), although
you could easily opt for Rackspace or one of the many Java hosts (Oxxus seemed
compelling too). EC2 has a free usage tier that fit the needs of the project
so I decided to go with it.</p>

<p>Amazon&#8217;s EC2 allows you to select disk images, called AMI&#8217;s (Amazon Machine
Image), and then install and run them seamlessly. You can spin up multiple
instances rapidly and manage every last detail about them. Access to these
AMI&#8217;s (what requests can go to them and from them) is controlled by Security
Groups, which need to be applied to instances. In the free-tier, you can&#8217;t
change a security group after selecting it at instance-creation-time. Also,
there are a lot of community-submitted AMI&#8217;s that you can use as well.</p>

<p>After logging in with my pre-existing Amazon AWS account, I went to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/">AWS
management console</a> and selected EC2.</p>

<p>Oh, cool! This console has a lot of options. You can actually launch your very
own server instance by following a simple wizard.</p>

<p>Ok, now that the platform has been selected and introduced, the next step is to select a good, base AMI that does most of the work for us. The AMI I used was the <a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/tomcatstack">Bitnami Tomcat stack</a> (ami-0eec1167), which is publicly available and can be used with the free-tier.</p>

<p>Now, I launched the instance-creation wizard from the AWS console.</p>

<p>As you can see, I entered the specific AMI id and then proceeded to select
the search item that matched.</p>

<p>Next, you need to select the first few configuration items about the new instance:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The defaults should suffice. After that, you can optionally enter some unique
key/value pairs for your own purposes. </p>

<p>And now comes a very important step, making and downloading your key. You need
to give a unique name and then download the given key to your computer. This
key will be used to SSH into your instance.</p>

<p>Most importantly, you need to define the Security Group to be used with your
instance. Remember, if you&#8217;re doing free-tier, this cannot be changed later.
For the different rules, add a Custom TCP rule for 0.0.0.0/0 with port 8080,
an HTTP rule for 0.0.0.0/0, and a Custom TCP rule for 0.0.0.0/0 for port 22.
Make sure the SSH port 22 rule shows up in the group&#8217;s definition.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>You should now have a functioning EC2 instance. Awesome! Now, SSH into that
baby:</p>

<p>[code] $ cd path/to/folder/containing/key $ ssh -i ./ bitnami@ [/code]</p>

<p>Replace with your key and with the instance&#8217;s public dns name (look in details).
Also, you can right-click on the instance in the AWS console and select &#8220;Connect&#8221;
to get your own personal ssh command.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: the root user for this AMI is manager/bitnami (check <a href="http://bitnami.org/faq/cloud_amazon_ec2">bitnami FAQ</a>
for details). I tend to log in with the bitnami user to my instance and then
use sudo for any admin commands.</em></p>

<p>A bit of an overview about Tomcat and TinyPM:</p>

<p>The webapps folder is like www in Apache. Individual WAR files can be unzipped
into folders inside webapps to deploy them. The environment variable $CATALINA_HOME
points to the root tomcat directory. Also, any .jar files that are dependencies
go in the lib folder. The installation procedure that can now be followed is
<a href="http://documentation.tinypm.com/display/DOC/Tomcat+6.0.x+%28from+WAR+file%29">here</a>. </p>

<p>After you&#8217;re logged in, do the following:</p>

<p>[code] $ Java -server -Xms256m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=96m -XX:+UseParallelGC
$ cd /opt/bitnami/apache-tomcat/webapps $ wget http://www.tinypm.com/downloads/tinypm-2.5.6-tomcat6.0.zip
$ sudo unzip tinypm-2.5.6-tomcat6.0.zip $ /opt/bitnami/apache-tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh
$ mkdir tinypm $ sudo unzip tinypm.war -d tinypm $ sudo cp dependency/* ../lib
[/code]</p>

<p>At this point, you have downloaded and installed the WAR file, taking care to shutdown Tomcat first. You&#8217;ve also moved TinyPM&#8217;s dependencies to Tomcat&#8217;s lib folder (you already have the mysql-java connector dependency fulfilled by the bitnami stack).</p>

<p> Next, you need to setup the mysql database. To do this, follow the directions for the database setup <a href="http://documentation.tinypm.com/display/DOC/Tomcat+6.0.x+%28from+WAR+file%29">here</a>. I kept the defaults just to keep things simple. If you change something, it can easily be accounted for in the hibernate.properties files under webapps/tinypm/WEB-INF/classes.</p>

<p>After that is done, you need to edit the file at $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/tinypm/WEB-INF/classes/hibernate.properties
so as to uncomment the line:</p>

<h1>hibernate.search.default.indexBase = /var/search_index/tinypm</h1>

<p>by removing the <code>#</code> sign. You might need to change permissions by doing:</p>

<p>$ sudo chmod +w hibernate.properties</p>

<p>Now, the next step is to create the folder that the above uncommented line
mentions:</p>

<p>[code] $ sudo mkdir /var/search_index /var/search_index/tinypm $ chown -R root /var/search_index/tinypm
[/code]</p>

<p>Finally, start your Tomcat server:</p>

<p>[code]$ /opt/bitnami/apache-tomcat/bin/startup.sh [/code]</p>

<p>And point your browser to /tinypm. The credentials are admin/admin.</p>

<p>Hope this is helpful for someone out there!</p>
