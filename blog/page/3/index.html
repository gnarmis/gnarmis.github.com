  <div class="entry-content"><p>After exploring some static site recipes in my <a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/staticRack">staticRack</a> project, I wanted
to explore the world of simple, static Content Management Systems. There is
a PHP implementation of that sort of idea in <a href="http://pulsecms.com/">Pulse CMS</a>, and Ruby has something
a bit different called <a href="http://nestacms.com/">Nesta</a>. The latter, in particular, is a great solution
if you love managing static sites with a desktop text editor and want a simple
way to customize or build completely new designs. I decided to explore a custom
CMS based on Sinatra to learn building apps with Rack and Sinatra.</p>

<p>The idea was to have a general-purpose layer that can be easily deployed using
pretty much any web server and that allows flexible management and development
of content. Imagine a RESTful API that abstracts away the messy local filesystem
and lets you create objects that are stored as static files. If you&#8217;re working
on a simple JavaScript client and want local filesystem access, such a layer
would be immensely helpful. There is also some separation of concerns between
the client and server and the whole thing starts looking like a general mini-framework
that can be used to target a wide range of problems. Also, after initial deployment,
such a project could allow continued development through a REST client on any
browser or even mobile device. And with the possibility of <a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Standalone.html">standalone deployment
with Passenger</a> and even simpler deployment with <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, such a project
can actually have widespread, general use.</p>

<p>I worked out some initial functionality and pushed it <a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/cozy">here</a>. I&#8217;m calling
it <strong>Cozy</strong>, and hopefully it evolves into a good way to make basic prototypes,
to have database-less dynamic web apps, or to manage static websites. For now,
Cozy can create, read, update, and delete &#8220;nodes,&#8221; which can be any kind of
file. There is also some authentication to protect the create, update, and
delete actions. The code is a little brittle right now, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>While the true capabilities and drawbacks are not clear yet, this idea of a
static REST backend is turning out to be a great educational project. If anything,
it can help inform a future attempt to create a light framework. In the meantime,
I&#8217;m absolutely loving Sinatra&#8217;s simplicity and will have some followups exploring
the specifics of Cozy.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is one of the best things I have discovered in a while.
It&#8217;s simply a huge open list of problems in numeric order that you can solve
using any math or code you want, provided that any code you write runs under
one minute.</p>

<p>The problems get interesting from the very start and are actually entertaining!
After reading <a href="https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maa.org%2Fdevlin%2FLockhartsLament.pdf&amp;h=dba0d">Lokhart&#8217;s Lament</a>, I&#8217;d say these problems would definitely
fit the category of challenging and yet stimulating. Math truly is an art,
and code is a cool way to access a subset of it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Anyway, primes! Here&#8217;s the problem itself:</p>

<p>The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.</p>

<p>What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s my solution (skip if you want to try this yourself!):</p>

<p>The code should be pretty much clear, at least except for that initial part
where I restrict the range. It was hard getting my super-easy-to-write-yet-inefficient
prime numbered array generator to solve for 600851475143 quickly. I was too
lazy to try to implement Sieve of Atkin so I just decided to try limiting the
range as much as I could. Apparently, if you take the root of the number of
digits in the given composite number, and then raise the upper limit of your
range to the inverse of that number, you get a much more limited range that
still gives you the right highest prime factor of the original number. I tried
this out down to two-digit composites and it seems to work.</p>

<p>Also, if I tried using a quick prime test on each element and deleting non-primes
that way (instead of a sieve), the performance was actually worse somehow.
And while trying to do this exact thing, I discovered a freaking <a href="http://www.noulakaz.net/weblog/2007/03/18/a-regular-expression-to-check-for-prime-numbers/">regular expression
that detects primes</a>! Yeah.</p>

<p>I literally spent close to three hours just researching a number of tangential
topics, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratothenes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Atkin">Sieve of Atkin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_theory">Sieve theory</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNFS">GNFS</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA">RSA</a>. While the problem itself wasn&#8217;t too challenging (I
ended up learning much more about Ruby, though), the whole experience was amazing.
And of course, there&#8217;s a lot of room for gains in efficiency too.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you sign up for an account on <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> and work
your way through some of those problems! It&#8217;s a great way to try out new languages,
learn more efficient techniques, or just have some fun. No, really, it&#8217;s actually
fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever looked for a way to quickly build a live prototype as a static
site that nevertheless had some sensible version control and had potential
for future extension? Well, I have a template (complete with very minimal HTML5
boilerplate) for you <a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/staticRack">right here</a>! Read on for details.</p>

<p>After recently experimenting with CoffeeScript (and loving it), I felt the
need to stage some code quickly somewhere. I already had my computer setup
for deployment to Heroku so that was the obvious choice, and a quick search
on the interwebz meant that my static sites could now run on Heroku easily.
The upside was that I could add a lot of complexity to such a website down
the road with minimal hassle. Basically, in the future I could build on it
as a Rack-based app or use one of the many easy Ruby frameworks that are Rack-based
(like Sinatra). Also, it would mean that I would use Git from the very start
of the process, adding some much needed version control to the early stages
of prototypes.</p>

<p>So, I basically extracted the basic code into a template, and even added a
branch for Sass and Coffeescript enthusiasts to have a base to build on. I
included some simple commands that free you up from the terminal so you can
still have the familiar edit/refresh development cycle with the convenience
of Coffee/Sass.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the main branch: https://github.com/gnarmis/staticRack</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the sassycoffee branch: https://github.com/gnarmis/staticRack/tree/sassycoffee</p>

<p>Clone the branch you want, customize, and push to Heroku. Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Windows users have long enjoyed OneNote, a truly great solution that has sensible
note-taking and note-management. However, those of us on macs, even after buying
Office for Mac, don&#8217;t quite have something that really solves that issue. Well,
I&#8217;ve finally found a solution that more than measures up to the challenge:
Circus Ponies&#8217; <a href="http://www.circusponies.com/">NoteBook</a>.</p>

<p>NoteBook looks, feels, and performs like you would expect it to - that&#8217;s reason
enough to use it for me. The past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been managing everything
I do, to some degree, with this app. And I&#8217;ve only just started discovering
the <a href="http://www.circusponies.com/technical-specifications">rich featureset</a>. From managing a complicated project that involves
a lot of research to everyday idea-management, I&#8217;ve just naturally been drawn
to using NoteBook exclusively.</p>

<p>One of the best things I found in NoteBook is that the core task that you do
(take notes) is extremely elegant and easy. Bullets are easily shuffled, contracted,
and deleted with simple shortcuts and external media attachment works perfectly.</p>

<p>Sketching out concepts with shapes and diagrams is also quite easy, and the
export functionality is also phenomenal. This app can spit out an entire website,
with the same slick tabs and expandable bullets as the app itself. Imagine
using this for quickly writing up the entire project outline for a new web
project, with research, issues, and wireframes, and then putting it up easily
on a local network (or behind some generic auth) for colleagues to share. It&#8217;s
really quite a flexible tool.</p>

<p>There are obviously other alternatives too. I&#8217;ve tried Evernote and while the
platform support is excellent, it didn&#8217;t result in me significantly changing
the way I take notes and organize them. Most importantly, I felt a lack of
the kind of support for mash-up notes that OneNote and NoteBook allow you to
make, which means including links, images, text, and anything else that is
relevant to a note in an elegant way. Also, every note-taking app should be
completely and easily accessible from the keyboard, which was another pain
point with Evernote for me. Of course, Evernote is available on many more platforms,
so it might still be a better option for some.</p>

<p>All I know is that OneNote will no longer be missed on my machine. And even
if it was ever offered on macs, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be switching anytime soon.</p>
