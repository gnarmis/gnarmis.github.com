  <div class="entry-content"><p>When developing locally, I find it useful to have the full development server
logs available. Luckily, Rails 3.1 does this for you in the file ./log/development.log.
However, if you want something similar for other frameworks/commands that run
continuously and post any errors, etc, directly to the terminal, something
like this is useful:</p>

<p>[code]rails s >> console.out 2>&amp;1 &amp;[/code]</p>

<p>(Replace <code>rails s</code> with any similar command)</p>

<p>Also, you can easily send signals (like ctrl-c) to background processes with
<code>kill</code>.</p>

<p>List of signals:</p>

<p>[code]kill -l[/code]</p>

<p>Closing a background process with id 1:</p>

<p>[code]kill -s SIGKILL %1[/code]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you use Sass and CoffeeScript? Tired of remembering and typing out the compile
and watch commands on both of those command-line utilities? I used to do:</p>

<p>[code] compass watch <br/>
 coffee -o scripts/ -cw coffee/ [/code]</p>

<p>&#8230;on all of my projects, in separate tabs on the terminal. There had to be
an easier way.</p>

<p>Do them both, with the standard configuration, using the script below. Download
it into your project, do</p>

<p>[code]chmod +x sassycoffee.sh[/code]</p>

<p>to make it executable, and forget about it! I&#8217;m planning on some edits in the
future, but it works well enough and gets the job done. Now, all you need to
do is:</p>

<p>[code]./sassycoffee.sh[/code]</p>

<p>This was a quick little hack in bash but pretty helpful for my workflow.</p>

<time datetime="2011-07-19T22:04:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 19<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a particularly interesting time trying to install TinyPM, which is a
Java-based project management solution. After searching el goog for a bit,
I couldn&#8217;t find an exact walkthrough or recipe, so I decided to make one here
for anyone else who&#8217;s looking into doing the same.</p>

<p>First, the platform. I chose Amazon&#8217;s Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2), although
you could easily opt for Rackspace or one of the many Java hosts (Oxxus seemed
compelling too). EC2 has a free usage tier that fit the needs of the project
so I decided to go with it.</p>

<p>Amazon&#8217;s EC2 allows you to select disk images, called AMI&#8217;s (Amazon Machine
Image), and then install and run them seamlessly. You can spin up multiple
instances rapidly and manage every last detail about them. Access to these
AMI&#8217;s (what requests can go to them and from them) is controlled by Security
Groups, which need to be applied to instances. In the free-tier, you can&#8217;t
change a security group after selecting it at instance-creation-time. Also,
there are a lot of community-submitted AMI&#8217;s that you can use as well.</p>

<p>After logging in with my pre-existing Amazon AWS account, I went to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/">AWS
management console</a> and selected EC2.</p>

<p>Oh, cool! This console has a lot of options. You can actually launch your very
own server instance by following a simple wizard.</p>

<p>Ok, now that the platform has been selected and introduced, the next step is to select a good, base AMI that does most of the work for us. The AMI I used was the <a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/tomcatstack">Bitnami Tomcat stack</a> (ami-0eec1167), which is publicly available and can be used with the free-tier.</p>

<p>Now, I launched the instance-creation wizard from the AWS console.</p>

<p>As you can see, I entered the specific AMI id and then proceeded to select
the search item that matched.</p>

<p>Next, you need to select the first few configuration items about the new instance:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The defaults should suffice. After that, you can optionally enter some unique
key/value pairs for your own purposes. </p>

<p>And now comes a very important step, making and downloading your key. You need
to give a unique name and then download the given key to your computer. This
key will be used to SSH into your instance.</p>

<p>Most importantly, you need to define the Security Group to be used with your
instance. Remember, if you&#8217;re doing free-tier, this cannot be changed later.
For the different rules, add a Custom TCP rule for 0.0.0.0/0 with port 8080,
an HTTP rule for 0.0.0.0/0, and a Custom TCP rule for 0.0.0.0/0 for port 22.
Make sure the SSH port 22 rule shows up in the group&#8217;s definition.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>You should now have a functioning EC2 instance. Awesome! Now, SSH into that
baby:</p>

<p>[code] $ cd path/to/folder/containing/key $ ssh -i ./ bitnami@ [/code]</p>

<p>Replace with your key and with the instance&#8217;s public dns name (look in details).
Also, you can right-click on the instance in the AWS console and select &#8220;Connect&#8221;
to get your own personal ssh command.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: the root user for this AMI is manager/bitnami (check <a href="http://bitnami.org/faq/cloud_amazon_ec2">bitnami FAQ</a>
for details). I tend to log in with the bitnami user to my instance and then
use sudo for any admin commands.</em></p>

<p>A bit of an overview about Tomcat and TinyPM:</p>

<p>The webapps folder is like www in Apache. Individual WAR files can be unzipped
into folders inside webapps to deploy them. The environment variable $CATALINA_HOME
points to the root tomcat directory. Also, any .jar files that are dependencies
go in the lib folder. The installation procedure that can now be followed is
<a href="http://documentation.tinypm.com/display/DOC/Tomcat+6.0.x+%28from+WAR+file%29">here</a>. </p>

<p>After you&#8217;re logged in, do the following:</p>

<p>[code] $ Java -server -Xms256m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=96m -XX:+UseParallelGC
$ cd /opt/bitnami/apache-tomcat/webapps $ wget http://www.tinypm.com/downloads/tinypm-2.5.6-tomcat6.0.zip
$ sudo unzip tinypm-2.5.6-tomcat6.0.zip $ /opt/bitnami/apache-tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh
$ mkdir tinypm $ sudo unzip tinypm.war -d tinypm $ sudo cp dependency/* ../lib
[/code]</p>

<p>At this point, you have downloaded and installed the WAR file, taking care to shutdown Tomcat first. You&#8217;ve also moved TinyPM&#8217;s dependencies to Tomcat&#8217;s lib folder (you already have the mysql-java connector dependency fulfilled by the bitnami stack).</p>

<p> Next, you need to setup the mysql database. To do this, follow the directions for the database setup <a href="http://documentation.tinypm.com/display/DOC/Tomcat+6.0.x+%28from+WAR+file%29">here</a>. I kept the defaults just to keep things simple. If you change something, it can easily be accounted for in the hibernate.properties files under webapps/tinypm/WEB-INF/classes.</p>

<p>After that is done, you need to edit the file at $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/tinypm/WEB-INF/classes/hibernate.properties
so as to uncomment the line:</p>

<h1>hibernate.search.default.indexBase = /var/search_index/tinypm</h1>

<p>by removing the <code>#</code> sign. You might need to change permissions by doing:</p>

<p>$ sudo chmod +w hibernate.properties</p>

<p>Now, the next step is to create the folder that the above uncommented line
mentions:</p>

<p>[code] $ sudo mkdir /var/search_index /var/search_index/tinypm $ chown -R root /var/search_index/tinypm
[/code]</p>

<p>Finally, start your Tomcat server:</p>

<p>[code]$ /opt/bitnami/apache-tomcat/bin/startup.sh [/code]</p>

<p>And point your browser to /tinypm. The credentials are admin/admin.</p>

<p>Hope this is helpful for someone out there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After exploring some static site recipes in my <a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/staticRack">staticRack</a> project, I wanted
to explore the world of simple, static Content Management Systems. There is
a PHP implementation of that sort of idea in <a href="http://pulsecms.com/">Pulse CMS</a>, and Ruby has something
a bit different called <a href="http://nestacms.com/">Nesta</a>. The latter, in particular, is a great solution
if you love managing static sites with a desktop text editor and want a simple
way to customize or build completely new designs. I decided to explore a custom
CMS based on Sinatra to learn building apps with Rack and Sinatra.</p>

<p>The idea was to have a general-purpose layer that can be easily deployed using
pretty much any web server and that allows flexible management and development
of content. Imagine a RESTful API that abstracts away the messy local filesystem
and lets you create objects that are stored as static files. If you&#8217;re working
on a simple JavaScript client and want local filesystem access, such a layer
would be immensely helpful. There is also some separation of concerns between
the client and server and the whole thing starts looking like a general mini-framework
that can be used to target a wide range of problems. Also, after initial deployment,
such a project could allow continued development through a REST client on any
browser or even mobile device. And with the possibility of <a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Standalone.html">standalone deployment
with Passenger</a> and even simpler deployment with <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, such a project
can actually have widespread, general use.</p>

<p>I worked out some initial functionality and pushed it <a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/cozy">here</a>. I&#8217;m calling
it <strong>Cozy</strong>, and hopefully it evolves into a good way to make basic prototypes,
to have database-less dynamic web apps, or to manage static websites. For now,
Cozy can create, read, update, and delete &#8220;nodes,&#8221; which can be any kind of
file. There is also some authentication to protect the create, update, and
delete actions. The code is a little brittle right now, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>While the true capabilities and drawbacks are not clear yet, this idea of a
static REST backend is turning out to be a great educational project. If anything,
it can help inform a future attempt to create a light framework. In the meantime,
I&#8217;m absolutely loving Sinatra&#8217;s simplicity and will have some followups exploring
the specifics of Cozy.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is one of the best things I have discovered in a while.
It&#8217;s simply a huge open list of problems in numeric order that you can solve
using any math or code you want, provided that any code you write runs under
one minute.</p>

<p>The problems get interesting from the very start and are actually entertaining!
After reading <a href="https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maa.org%2Fdevlin%2FLockhartsLament.pdf&amp;h=dba0d">Lokhart&#8217;s Lament</a>, I&#8217;d say these problems would definitely
fit the category of challenging and yet stimulating. Math truly is an art,
and code is a cool way to access a subset of it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Anyway, primes! Here&#8217;s the problem itself:</p>

<p>The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.</p>

<p>What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s my solution (skip if you want to try this yourself!):</p>

<p>The code should be pretty much clear, at least except for that initial part
where I restrict the range. It was hard getting my super-easy-to-write-yet-inefficient
prime numbered array generator to solve for 600851475143 quickly. I was too
lazy to try to implement Sieve of Atkin so I just decided to try limiting the
range as much as I could. Apparently, if you take the root of the number of
digits in the given composite number, and then raise the upper limit of your
range to the inverse of that number, you get a much more limited range that
still gives you the right highest prime factor of the original number. I tried
this out down to two-digit composites and it seems to work.</p>

<p>Also, if I tried using a quick prime test on each element and deleting non-primes
that way (instead of a sieve), the performance was actually worse somehow.
And while trying to do this exact thing, I discovered a freaking <a href="http://www.noulakaz.net/weblog/2007/03/18/a-regular-expression-to-check-for-prime-numbers/">regular expression
that detects primes</a>! Yeah.</p>

<p>I literally spent close to three hours just researching a number of tangential
topics, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratothenes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Atkin">Sieve of Atkin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_theory">Sieve theory</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNFS">GNFS</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA">RSA</a>. While the problem itself wasn&#8217;t too challenging (I
ended up learning much more about Ruby, though), the whole experience was amazing.
And of course, there&#8217;s a lot of room for gains in efficiency too.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you sign up for an account on <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> and work
your way through some of those problems! It&#8217;s a great way to try out new languages,
learn more efficient techniques, or just have some fun. No, really, it&#8217;s actually
fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever looked for a way to quickly build a live prototype as a static
site that nevertheless had some sensible version control and had potential
for future extension? Well, I have a template (complete with very minimal HTML5
boilerplate) for you <a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/staticRack">right here</a>! Read on for details.</p>

<p>After recently experimenting with CoffeeScript (and loving it), I felt the
need to stage some code quickly somewhere. I already had my computer setup
for deployment to Heroku so that was the obvious choice, and a quick search
on the interwebz meant that my static sites could now run on Heroku easily.
The upside was that I could add a lot of complexity to such a website down
the road with minimal hassle. Basically, in the future I could build on it
as a Rack-based app or use one of the many easy Ruby frameworks that are Rack-based
(like Sinatra). Also, it would mean that I would use Git from the very start
of the process, adding some much needed version control to the early stages
of prototypes.</p>

<p>So, I basically extracted the basic code into a template, and even added a
branch for Sass and Coffeescript enthusiasts to have a base to build on. I
included some simple commands that free you up from the terminal so you can
still have the familiar edit/refresh development cycle with the convenience
of Coffee/Sass.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the main branch: https://github.com/gnarmis/staticRack</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the sassycoffee branch: https://github.com/gnarmis/staticRack/tree/sassycoffee</p>

<p>Clone the branch you want, customize, and push to Heroku. Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Windows users have long enjoyed OneNote, a truly great solution that has sensible
note-taking and note-management. However, those of us on macs, even after buying
Office for Mac, don&#8217;t quite have something that really solves that issue. Well,
I&#8217;ve finally found a solution that more than measures up to the challenge:
Circus Ponies&#8217; <a href="http://www.circusponies.com/">NoteBook</a>.</p>

<p>NoteBook looks, feels, and performs like you would expect it to - that&#8217;s reason
enough to use it for me. The past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been managing everything
I do, to some degree, with this app. And I&#8217;ve only just started discovering
the <a href="http://www.circusponies.com/technical-specifications">rich featureset</a>. From managing a complicated project that involves
a lot of research to everyday idea-management, I&#8217;ve just naturally been drawn
to using NoteBook exclusively.</p>

<p>One of the best things I found in NoteBook is that the core task that you do
(take notes) is extremely elegant and easy. Bullets are easily shuffled, contracted,
and deleted with simple shortcuts and external media attachment works perfectly.</p>

<p>Sketching out concepts with shapes and diagrams is also quite easy, and the
export functionality is also phenomenal. This app can spit out an entire website,
with the same slick tabs and expandable bullets as the app itself. Imagine
using this for quickly writing up the entire project outline for a new web
project, with research, issues, and wireframes, and then putting it up easily
on a local network (or behind some generic auth) for colleagues to share. It&#8217;s
really quite a flexible tool.</p>

<p>There are obviously other alternatives too. I&#8217;ve tried Evernote and while the
platform support is excellent, it didn&#8217;t result in me significantly changing
the way I take notes and organize them. Most importantly, I felt a lack of
the kind of support for mash-up notes that OneNote and NoteBook allow you to
make, which means including links, images, text, and anything else that is
relevant to a note in an elegant way. Also, every note-taking app should be
completely and easily accessible from the keyboard, which was another pain
point with Evernote for me. Of course, Evernote is available on many more platforms,
so it might still be a better option for some.</p>

<p>All I know is that OneNote will no longer be missed on my machine. And even
if it was ever offered on macs, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be switching anytime soon.</p>
