  <p>Introducing Rocketship: a Rack based template that integrates multiple micro-frameworks.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gnarmis/rocketship"><strong>github.com/gnarmis/rocketship</strong></a></p>
<p>I recently came across some useful Sinatra templates and ended up having to integrate several things together in a service I’m currently working on. So, I extracted the basic stuff out and it’s turned out to be useful for spinning up a quick web service. Best thing is that it doesn’t impose a strict structure and you can follow best-practices of your micro-framework of choice.</p>
<p>Currently, Rocketship integrates Grape and Sinatra, along with a bevy of testing facilities.</p>
<p>Comments/improvements welcome!</p>
<p>Update: Some significant changes, including one that makes apps able to handle more requests concurrently.</p>
