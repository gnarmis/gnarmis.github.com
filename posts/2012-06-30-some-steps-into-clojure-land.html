  <p>I’m really digging this wonderful little language called Clojure. It’s a modern Lisp, meaning it has all the functional goodness I have been craving after using Racket. It’s awesome being able to build things like interpreters and type checkers, which I didn’t think I’d be able to approach so easily (this was part of an awesome programming languages class taught by Robbie Findler). But Clojure is also a JVM language and can be compiled ahead of time, so it’s exceedingly practical and efficient. You can use any Java library and interop with other JVM languages pretty well.</p>
<p>Clojure is a young language, but has a very energetic community. It’s also seeing use both in industry and startups. Check out <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Clojure-powered-Startups">this talk</a> for more on that.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of resources out there too. I’ve gone through parts of <a href="http://www.clojurebook.com/">Clojure Programming</a>, done some challenges on <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/">4Clojure</a>, played around with <a href="http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/06/24/its-playtime/">Light Table Playground</a>, and keep finding more things to explore. One book I definitely want to explore is <a href="http://joyofclojure.com/">The Joy of Clojure</a>. Also, I’ve decided to go through SICP using clojure, and ran across <a href="http://sicpinclojure.com/">this gem</a>.</p>
<p>As for tools, I’ve tried <a href="http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/">CounterClockwise</a> and <a href="http://devnet.jetbrains.net/community/idea/clojure">La Clojure</a>, but for now I’ve settled for my usual lightweight editor: Sublime Text 2, with SublimeREPL. Having a syntax-highlighted REPL that behaves like my editor is pretty nice. <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/">Leiningen</a> has been brilliant as a dependency-management tool, which also supports a host of other things like building, testing, running, or launching a REPL with your project. Honestly, Leiningen is the best dependency manager I’ve ever used. I wish there was something this good in Ruby-land.</p>
<p>A great place to find links to all sorts of tools for Clojure development is <a href="http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/">Clojure Toolbox</a>. It shows how practical Clojure is today.</p>
<p>I have to mention <a href="http://webnoir.org/">Noir</a> and <a href="http://sqlkorma.com/">Korma</a>. If you’re into web dev, you might find yourself loving the simplicity of Noir and the interesting functional approach to persistence in Korma. I find it awesome that <a href="http://chris-granger.com/">Chris Granger</a>, the guy behind Light Table, wrote both of them.</p>
<p>Btw, #clojure on irc.freenode.net is friendly!</p>
